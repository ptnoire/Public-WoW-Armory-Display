# Public-WoW-Armory-Display
My wife asked me to do this, so I'm doing it. It's just a site that will display a 3d model viewer for your wow character that looks really nice. [In Progress]

Edit: Wow doesn't support a 3d model viewer anymore (just the site wowhead) so I changed the direction into something else she had asked me to do earlier which is a mount list
that she can easily see what she has and doesn't have.

using the blizz api, i got most of this done. Just have to compare to a master list (maybe find an API  or just take from something else.

and also style the website too, I guess that would be nice. CSS skills woo.
